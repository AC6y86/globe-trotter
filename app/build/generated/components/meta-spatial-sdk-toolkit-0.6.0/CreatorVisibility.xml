  <Component name="CreatorVisibility">
    <Description>
Use this Component to hide an Entity from every user except for the creator
of the Entity or hide the entity from only the creator. This *MUST* be used
with dynamically created Entities, Entities created using scene.xml do not
have a "creator" and so will not be hidden.

This Component is currently only designed for simple use like having an object or panel that
only the creator can see. If you need more complex visibility logic you will need to write
your own Visibility Component and System, feel free to use this one as a reference.

@param state The state of the visibility, see CreatorVisibilityState for more info
